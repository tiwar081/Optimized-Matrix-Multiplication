In this project, I program matrix multiplication in RISC-V.
All relevant files can be found in the project directory.

The directory is organized by function. The main function calls classify, the primary codefile.
Details of which registers should contain what information when running each function is contained at the start of each function file.

Test files demonstrate use of each function. They were also useful in debugging, the primary challenge of RISC-V programming.
